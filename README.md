# Terrraforming-Mars
Delivering results of political will within electioncycles: year1, 2, 3, 4- 1.CFD proof, 2.microhabitat proof, 3.Starship landingthrusters shaping sediment, 4.Observing viable habitatzones forming on Mars.

Like the sludge in a barrel can be gathered indirectly by gyrating the barrel... 
Largest mountain in the solar system - Antipodean coreshift "indent" likely present //TODO: Gravity specific measurements to verify planetary core (mis)alignment.
Observations: Surfacetension appear approaching ; for particles descending Olympus Mons encased in solid aggregates of methane/Co2. Icecrystals breaking as the aggregate (iceclumps of methane etc) makes ready the transition back to gaseous aggregate-state , thus afacilitating lowpressureszone against the backdraft of the pressuwave (so the object falling is sucked forward while ...) highpressurezones form instantenously everywhgere the icecrystals would touch the surface.  This is boundarylayers to glide on. Ground-effect excarebvate thgis by action of 'virtal lifttension' pushing outwards by the colliding force of ventuyri upstream and cold shit falling down after clumping athigh altitude.
